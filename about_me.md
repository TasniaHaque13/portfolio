About Me
Hello! I am Tasnia Haque. I have completed my undergrad in Urban and Regional Planning from Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET), Bangladesh in March 2024. My personal and professional interests are driven by a desire to contribute meaningful work for the earth, the environment, and communities. My academic interests focus on applying geospatial and data-driven approaches to address challenges at the intersection of urban systems, environmental change, and climate adaptation.
My research focuses on the intersection of climate processes, environmental hazards, land-use dynamics, urban resilience, sustainability, transportation systems, inclusive placemaking, and public health. I am particularly interested in understanding the dynamic relationships among these domains and how they collectively influence ecological and urban systems. My goal is to contribute toward improving ecological balance and creating more inclusive, resilient urban environments.
I employ spatial analytics and urban informatics to analyze patterns, risk, land-use dynamics and green infrastructure networks, and land-use dynamics, with the aim of contributing to evidence-based planning and policy design, including sustainable energy and climate-adaptive strategies. I am passionate about exploring new fields and widening my horizon. I have been actively involved in various research projects since my undergraduate studies and am always willing to learn and grow.
Alongside my academic interests, I am motivated to work with vulnerable and marginalized communities, particularly women, to address the challenges posed by climate change.
Outside academics, I enjoy working in groups and participating in different activities. I have been involved in organizing events, programs, and functions at both my school and university. I enjoy sports and have a strong interest in art, and since my school years, I have contributed to design and backstage decoration work.
I also actively participate in voluntary activities and have been involved with non-profit organizations, where I have volunteered, supported event planning, mentored peers, and taken on leadership responsibilities. In addition, I have participated in various training programs and workshops, which have helped me develop stronger communication skills, project coordination abilities, and experience working in collaborative environments.
